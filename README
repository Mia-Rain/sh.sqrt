# sh.sqrt
-- Square Root (âˆš) in pure POSIX sh
---- various methods included; see

# Babylonian Method
-- The Babylonian method is the first to be implemented
-- Since sh can only actively work with whole numbers on its own
-- The method is actually quite accurate
-- However (obv) a break down occurs when numbers without 
---- whole Square Roots are inputed, however;
---- the algorithm should/has (have) been adjusted to detect when it 
---- enters and endless loop, and should produce the closest whole number
-- This method requires a starting seed; POSIX sh however lacks $RANDOM
-- thus psh-prng is used by this method; one will have to clone with
---- `--recursive` to pull in the submodule
